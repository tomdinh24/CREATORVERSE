# WEB103 Prework - Creatorverse

Submitted by: Tom Lam

About this web app: 
A web application for all content creators to promote their background information and social media

Time spent: 15

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **A logical component structure in React is used to create the frontend of the app**
- [X] **At least five content creators are displayed on the homepage of the app**
- [X] **Each content creator item includes their name, a link to their channel/page, and a short description of their content**
- [ ] **API calls use the async/await design pattern via Axios or fetch()**
- [X] **Clicking on a content creator item takes the user to their details page, which includes their name, url, and description**
- [X] **Each content creator has their own unique URL**
- [X] **The user can edit a content creator to change their name, url, or description**
- [X] **The user can delete a content creator**
- [X] **The user can add a new content creator by entering a name, url, or description and then it is displayed on the homepage**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Picocss is used to style HTML elements
- [X] The content creator items are displayed in a creative format, like cards instead of a list
- [X] An image of each content creator is shown on their content creator card

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- Each single creator page has its unique URL link based on the creator name, not a randomly generated number. This feature was made similar to other social
  webpages like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc.
- On hover, each creator card gets a little bigger with a under glow to attract user to check out the user information
- Instead of using axios or fetch, I used Supabase documentation to retrieve data using the URL and API key

## Notes
During the project, one of the challenges I faced was figuring out how to complete one of the requirements of the project which is using Axios or Fetch to access
the data from Supabase. For 5 hours of the project, I tried looking through Codepath's prework support slack web103 advance web dev channel but wasn't able to get the restful API to work. 
I personally would be interested in learning how one would go about this requirement.
